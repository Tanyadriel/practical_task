Babe don't try to call
My heart is ticking and the show, just won't wait

It's strange, you couldn't see it my way, hey now go
I pray for you to fall
The spark, has died and now you're just too late  

A shame, you're knocking at the wrong gate, hey go home
Come what may, I won't give away

My love, diamond rings and Chevrolets
My love, aces high and cigarettes
My love, faking all like Hollywood
My love, love, love

No way you'll see me crawl
Like a shark I'll be ripping you apart, and celebrate
With lots of champagne, you caught me on the wrong day, now you know
 
Come what may, I won't give away
